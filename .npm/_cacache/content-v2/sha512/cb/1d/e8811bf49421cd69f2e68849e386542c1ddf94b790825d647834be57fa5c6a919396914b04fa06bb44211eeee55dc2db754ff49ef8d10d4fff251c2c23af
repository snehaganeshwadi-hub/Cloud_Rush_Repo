is a fast polyfill for [`TextEncoder`][1] and [`TextDecoder`][2], which let you encode and decode JavaScript strings into UTF-8 bytes.\n\nIt is fast partially as it does not support^ any encodings aside UTF-8 (and note that natively, only `TextDecoder` supports alternative encodings anyway).\nSee [some benchmarks](https://github.com/samthor/fast-text-encoding/tree/master/bench).\n\n^If this polyfill used on Node v5.1 through v11 (when `Text...` was introduced), then this simply wraps `Buffer`, which supports many encodings and is native code.\n\n[1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder\n[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder\n\n# Usage\n\nInstall as \"fast-text-encoding\" via your favourite package manager.\n\nYou only need this polyfill if you're supporting older browsers like IE, legacy Edge, ancient Chrome and Firefox, or Node before v11.\n\n## Browser\n\nInclude the minified code inside a `<script>` tag or as an ES6 Module for its side effects.\nIt will create `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` if the symbols are missing on `window` or `global.`\n\n```html\n<script src=\"node_modules/fast-text-encoding/text.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import './node_modules/fast-text-encoding/text.min.js';\n  import 'fast-text-encoding';  // or perhaps this\n  // confidently do something with TextEncoder or TextDecoder \\o/\n</script>\n```\n\n⚠️ You'll probably want to depend on \"text.min.js\", as it's compiled to ES5 for older environments.\n\n## Not Including Polyfill\n\nIf your project doesn't need the polyfill, but is included as a transitive dependency, we publish [an empty version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-text-encoding/v/0.0.0-empty) that you could pin NPM or similar's version algorithm to.\nUse \"fast-text-encoding@empty\".\n","maintainers":[{"name":"samthor","email":"sam.thorogood@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-08-30T22:48:14.460Z","created":"2017-09-01T05:06:55.583Z","1.0.0":"2017-09-01T05:06:55.583Z","1.0.1":"2020-03-06T04:43:53.860Z","1.0.2":"2020-04-22T01:43:51.049Z","1.0.3":"2020-06-16T00:56:20.888Z","1.0.4":"2022-06-20T23:47:36.900Z","0.0.0-empty":"2022-08-30T22:27:59.350Z","1.0.6":"2022-08-30T22:48:14.394Z"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/samthor/fast-text-encoding.git"},"author":{"name":"Sam
